# Chat working skills

## Apply this guidance

Use this file when planning, implementing, debugging, or reviewing Chat.
Read [the README](../README.md), [TASK.md](TASK.md), and [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) first.
This file is component guidance. It does not install a global Codex skill or grant a runtime capability.

## Domain responsibilities

Tenant channels, direct and group messaging, attachments, realtime delivery, and the optional Telegram integration.

Check channel membership and live permissions before record access or delivery. Keep Telegram credentials server-side and preserve tenant-scoped audit and message ownership.

## Implementation rules

- Inspect the affected source and public contracts before editing.
- Keep concrete business behavior in its owning leaf or package.
- Preserve authoritative validation, permission checks, and data ownership.
- Add worker, event, or sync roles only when they contain real implemented behavior.
- Keep secrets, generated files, and local runtime data out of source control.
- Run npm commands from the repository root. Write generated output under root `dist`.
- Update this owner documentation when scope, contracts, or supported operations change.

## Review and evidence

For a small change, inspect the affected code and use at most one focused check when useful.
Inspection can suffice for a trivial edit. Add checks when the actual risk requires them.
The commands below are options for full verification, not a checklist for every prompt.

- `node tools/check-module-boundaries.mjs chat`
- `npm run typecheck -w @codexsun/chat-api`
- `npm run lint -w @codexsun/chat-api`
- `npm run build -w @codexsun/chat-api`
- `npm run typecheck -w @codexsun/chat-web`
- `npm run lint -w @codexsun/chat-web`
- `npm run build -w @codexsun/chat-web`

Check affected consumers as needed. Report material verification limits and blocked checks.
Documentation and prompts never replace backend authorization or deployment approval.
